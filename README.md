heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-webp
===========================

Use [ImageMagick](www.imagemagick.org) built with [libwebp](https://code.google.com/p/webp/) inside a Heroku _Cedar_ environment. This buildpack will download both libraries, build them from source and install them along side your app. Your ```$PATH``` and ```$LD_LIBRARY_PATH``` will also be updated to use this version of ImageMagick instead of the default Heroku one, which does _not_ currently have libwebp support.

Since this buildpack is building libwebp and ImageMagick from source your first deploy will take a very long time (around 10 mins). However after building once the installed libraries are stored in a cache directory and will be used for all future deploys. If for any reason you want to force a rebuild of libwebp and ImageMagick, please check out the [heroku-repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-repo) plugin.

## Usage

This buildpack is meant to be used through
[heroku-buildpack-multi](https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi),
so in your app you need to:
```
heroku config:set BUILDPACK_URL=https://github.com/ddollar/heroku-buildpack-multi
```

Then create a `.buildpacks` file inside your app:
```
https://github.com/tomymehdi/heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-webp
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby
```

The second line is for a nodejs buildpack, but it can be any other buildpack you want. If it is not working with yours, please report a bug.

## Verify Installation

You can verify that ImageMagick was built with libwebp support by running the following:

```
heroku run "identify -list format"
```

If the output includes ```WEBP* rw-   WebP Image Format (libwebp 0.4.2)``` then you're all set.
